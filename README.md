# Vehicle Speed GPS

speeder sounds for my EV bike.

It should use the accelerometer/GPS of the phone to check gather speed/acceleration data and be able to connect to a bluetooth speaker to play all this louder.

In the file I send, there are 

-all the sounds that you need

-a description for each + examples of similar projects but more complex



About the app. It should have a start button to start the sound simulation, and a stop button. It should play the different sounds smoothly to simulate a star was speeder based on acceleration and speed.



Let's have a call if you want more details.

**Files description**

1-Boot: When you start your vehicule / press the button start on the app. Also when you decelerate
Play 0 - 11 seconds then a loop of 5- to 10 seconds to have a smooth and steady engin simulation
Play 12 - 19 seconds when decelerating

2-Acceleration: You acceleration normaly from 0 to 30km/h
Play 0 - 11 seconds 

3-Gear up acceleration: You accelerate rapidly and gain +10% of speed within 2 seconds between 20km/h to 50 km/h
Play the whole file on top of engine sounds

4-Gear up strong acceleration: You accelerate rapidly and gain +20% of speed within 2 seconds between 55km/h to 110 Km/h
Play the whole file on top of engine sounds

5-Engine sound: this has to be a loop when you keep the same speed
Play the whole file


6-Engine sound fast: this is a sound when when accelerate really fast, between 0 - 30Km/h at full power
Play the whole file on top

7-Speed sound: this is a sound to show speed play it every time the vehicule reaches 80km/h
